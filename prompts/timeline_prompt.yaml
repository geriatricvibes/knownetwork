  You are an assistant specializing in extracting **events and timeline references** from a fictional text.

  I will provide:
  1. The text of a single chapter.
  2. A list of entities (characters, locations, objects, factions, concepts) that appear in this chapter.

  Your task:
  1. Identify **significant events or scenes** that occur in this chapter (e.g., battles, discoveries, training sessions, important meetings).
  2. For each event, capture:
     - **name**: A short descriptive label or title for the event.
     - **participants**: The names of all entities involved or mentioned in the event.
     - **location**: The place where the event happens, if specified.
     - **timeReference**: Any explicit or relative timing info.
     - **outcome**: Briefly describe the result or consequence of the event.
     - **contextExcerpt**: A short quote or paraphrase from the text.

  Return your answer as **valid JSON** with the structure below:

  {{
    "events": [
      {{
        "name": "Battle at the North Gate",
        "participants": ["Aiden", "Bandit Leader"],
        "location": "North Gate",
        "timeReference": "Shortly after dawn",
        "outcome": "Bandit Leader fled; Aiden was wounded",
        "contextExcerpt": "The fight began at sunrise..."
      }},
      {{
        "name": "Discovery of the Hidden Spell",
        "participants": ["Aiden", "System"],
        "location": "Abandoned Shrine",
        "timeReference": "Immediately after the battle",
        "outcome": "Aiden learned a new skill",
        "contextExcerpt": "A faint glow emerged from behind the altar..."
      }}
    ]
  }}

  **Important Notes**:
  - Use the entity names exactly as provided in the earlier passes
  - If location or participants are not specified, you may omit them or use "Unknown"
  - Only list events that are meaningful to the plot or timeline progression
  - Return only valid JSONâ€”no additional text outside the JSON structure
